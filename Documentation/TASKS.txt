Maksym: 
	+ Implement jumping of block. My proposition is create interface Jumpable 
wich objects must implement function jump(). Tote that jump operation requires:
		* To be limited in height by N, when N is integer number of heights of 
the player's unit, i.e. when unit has e.g. 5N of height under position of 
start jumping it's horizontal speed becames 0 and it starts falling.
		* Unit can not jump without something under it. If unit stays on smth. 
jump should cause jumping, butif jump called during flying in must has no 
effect.
	if we will have Jumpable interface, some kinds of units could implement it, 
so we could create function jump in the world which takes Jumpable object as 
parameter, and call this function passing player's unit to it when space is 
pressed.

Nastia:

Mykhailo:
	+ Create in the Game dictionary or map Unit : Image which will contain 
image for each unit. Add to GameAPI and Game function which returns map of 
coordinates : image as alternative for getAllUnitsCoordinates();
